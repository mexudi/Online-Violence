# Online-Violence

## Project Background

According to recent studies, cyberbullying is a growing concern in Morocco, particularly among young people. Many children and adolescents are experiencing online harassment, primarily on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. This is particularly alarming for vulnerable age groups, such as 10-13 year olds, who are already at risk of being victims of bullying. While some efforts have been made to address the issue, more needs to be done to protect children and provide them with the necessary resources and support to prevent and cope with cyberbullying. Parents, educators, and policymakers all have a role to play in promoting safe and responsible use of technology, educating young people on how to report cyberbullying incidents, and providing counseling and other support services to those who have been affected. 

To remedy this problem, we will be creating an NLP classifier to detect whether an online post is harmful to children.

## Problem Statment

The project's goal is to reduce the exploitation and abuse of children online, which has seen a drastic increase in recent years. Child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) have increased by an alarming 15,000% from 2005 to 2020, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received a record-breaking 29.3 million reports of CSAM in 2021. Adults who have a sexual interest in children or intend to harm them often use online grooming to establish contact with them. Grooming is a complex and multidimensional process, where an adult seeks to engage a child in a seemingly voluntary interaction with the intention of sexually abusing them. Research suggests that children who are targeted by online grooming may not recognize the danger until it's too late, making it important to educate and raise awareness among children about the risks of online grooming and provide them with the necessary resources and support to protect themselves.
