# Online-Violence

## Project Background
According to recent studies, cyberbullying is a growing concern in Morocco, particularly among young people. Many children and adolescents are experiencing online harassment, primarily on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. This is particularly alarming for vulnerable age groups, such as 10-13 year olds, who are already at risk of being victims of bullying. While some efforts have been made to address the issue, more needs to be done to protect children and provide them with the necessary resources and support to prevent and cope with cyberbullying. Parents, educators, and policymakers all have a role to play in promoting safe and responsible use of technology, educating young people on how to report cyberbullying incidents, and providing counseling and other support services to those who have been affected. To remedy this problem, we will be creating an NLP classifier to detect whether an online post is harmful to children.
